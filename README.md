# Peer to Peer Chat between iOS devices
This app was developed to suport the thesis created by the students Alan Wesley de Souza (github.com/alanwess) and William Seppelfeld, with the idea of an app that could be used in class to support teacher and bring the class to the digital era, this app is a beta version that allows students and teachers to transfer messages and images.
This app allows Teachers to create classes and add the studens, using only bluetooth and wifi, without the need of any external communication, and allows users to backup data direct to their emails.
It was used as based to this app the API Multipeer Connectivity (APPLE).
That project supports the implemantation video and file sharing, if implemented.
